Create a clean, minimal illustration of a classic matchstick puzzle on a neutral light background. Show straight, uniform sticks (without match heads) arranged to form the incorrect equation “1 + 8 = 18” using the sticks as digital-style straight segments for each number and for the plus and equals signs.
The sticks should look like simple wooden rods with subtle texture and soft shadows, all perfectly straight.
Arrange the full equation horizontally across the center of the image like a puzzle laid on a tabletop.
Above the stick equation, add the caption text in clear, bold, easy-to-read sans serif typography:
"Solve the equation by moving 2 sticks"
Below the stick equation, add the caption text in small font clear, bold, easy-to-read sans serif typography:
"Use = sign only"
Keep the style simple and educational, suitable for a math puzzle worksheet, with no extra decorations. Use a 16:9 landscape aspect ratio
